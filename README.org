* Emacs setup file
  Well, this is simply the configuration file of some emacs noob.
  I am just starting to learn some LISP, either emacs lisp, clojure, or common lisp,
  and the contents of this repository are solely for the purpose of storing my
  configurations so that I might be able to re-use them when I need to.
