* Emacs setup file
  The last repository I used to store my emacs configurations was broken for some reason.
  Fortnately the dat√¶ are not lost. So I can create a new repository to store my
  configurations again.

  I think I know a little emacs-lisp, so I am able to fix some not-so-serious errors
  during this set-up. In other words, feel free to point any errors out which are
  encoutnered using this configuration.
